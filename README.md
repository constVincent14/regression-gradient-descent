# Gradient-Descent-for-Linear-Regression
This repo contains python library code that I've build using concept of gradient descent to help solve basic linear regression problems. Gradient descent is quite useful to use when you have quite a large data and features. But the downside of this method is we have to specified some parameters as a starting point to run gradient descent and also we have to choose a correct "learning rate" to run gradient descent, this is the tricky part of gradient descent. But the more you run gradient descent, the more you're familiar to choose correct "learning rate" and initial parameters.
